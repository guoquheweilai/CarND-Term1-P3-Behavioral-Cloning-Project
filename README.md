# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Need revisit
Part of the project was completed and need more work on the rest of the project and documentation.

## As a suggestion, the README.md file for each repository can include the following information:
### a list of files contained in the repository with a brief description of each file
1. example_code_training_ec2_gpu.py (source code)
2. model.h5 (Saved model)
3. run1.mp4 (Video in autonomous mode)
4. drive.py (Source code, from Udacity, no changes)
5. README.md (Readme file)
6. writeup.md (Writeup file)
 
### any instructions someone might need for running your code
1. Configure your conda environment with Udacity [CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)
2. Install Open CV
pip install opencv-python
2. AWS EC2
3. PuTTY
4. WinSCP

### an overview of the project
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. You will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.
